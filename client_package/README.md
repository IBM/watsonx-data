## IBM watsonx.data client package
The watsonx.data client package includes convenient utilities and pre-packaged libraries to access and develop applications that work with IBM watsonx.data. For more information see [watsonx.data client package](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonxdata/1.0.x?topic=package-installing-lh-client)

## Installing watsonx.data client package
To install watsonx.data client package, you will need the ibm-lh-client.tgz and the container images.

### Before you begin
1. You need to procure credentials to access the container images for the client package hosted in the IBM container registry. 
    If you have purchased watsonx.data, you can use your entitlement key from [My IBM](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary?_gl=1%2a1o6moo1%2a_ga%2aMTgxNzQxMzQ4OS4xNjk0NTg0Nzky%2a_ga_FYECCCS21D%2aMTY5NDY1NzI0Ny43LjEuMTY5NDY1NzcxMC4wLjAuMA..). If you have not purchased watsonx.data, reach out to your IBM contact to get the read key to access the watsonx.data images. Depending on how the entitlement key was generated, you will need to specify the users as either `iamapikey` or `cp`.
2. Setup a single-node virtual machine to install the package. The supported operating system environments are
- Linux
- Windows
- Mac OS x86
- Mac with Apple Silicon with Rosetta. For more information see [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonxdata/1.0.x?topic=version-prerequisites-watsonxdata-installation-mac)
3. Install `docker` or `podman` on the machine to run the container images. 
<br>If you are using SUSE Linux, `podman` is only availaible for version SLES 15.4. Also, make sure to upgrade the system first (`zypper dist-upgrade`) before installing the dependencies that are not provided but are needed for the installation of `docker` or `podman`. 

For Docker:
- `sysuser-shadow` in SLES 12.5
- `catatonit` in SLES 15.5

For Podman:
- `fuse-overlayfs` in SLES 15.4

Packages can be downloaded from the [official site](https://software.opensuse.org/package/).


4. Install `podman-plugins`. It is important that you install `podman-plugins` before intalling watsonx.data.
```
yum install -y podman-plugins
```
For SUSE, install [cni-plugin-dnsname](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:ojkastl_buildservice:docker_compose_etc/cni-plugin-dnsname) instead.

5. Determine the version of watsonx.data that you want to install, and transfer respective the ibm-lh-client-<version>.tgz to the machine, say to `/tmp`


### Procedure
1. Set up the installation directory and environment variables

a. Set up a work directory. For example
   ```
   mkdir ~/ibm-watsonx-data
   cd  ~/ibm-watsonx-data
   ```
b. Download and extract the client package<br>
   ```
   wget https://github.com/IBM/watsonx-data/releases/download/v1.1.4/ibm-lh-client-1.1.4-120-20240410-200742-onprem-v1.1.4.tgz
   ``` 
   ```
   tar -xvf ibm-lh-client-1.1.4-120-20240410-200742-onprem-v1.1.4.tgz
   ```
   This will create a directory by the name `ibm-lh-client`
   
c. Review the license files located under `~/ibm-watsonx-data/ibm-lh-client/licenses`

2. Set the environment variables
   <br>If you have purchased watsonx.data, you should pull the container images from `cp.icr.io/cp/watsonx-data`
   ```
   export LH_REGISTRY=cp.icr.io/cp/watsonx-data
   ```
   If you have not purchased watsonx.data and have a readkey from IBM, you should pull the container images from `icr.io/watsonx_data_dev_client_pkg`
   ```
   export LH_REGISTRY=icr.io/watsonx_data_dev_client_pkg
   ```
3. Authenticate to the container registry
   ```
   docker login $LH_REGISTRY -u iamapikey -p <credentials>
   ```
   or
   ```
   podman login $LH_REGISTRY -u iamapikey -p <credentials>
   ```
4. Optional: You can customize your installation by editting the values in `~/ibm-watsonx-data/ibm-lh-client/etc/launch_config.env`
5. Run the setup script
   ```
   ./ibm-lh-client/bin/setup --license_acceptance=y --runtime=docker
   ```
   or
   ```
   ./ibm-lh-client/bin/setup --license_acceptance=y --runtime=podman
   ```
   This will pull the images from the container registry and start the container.
