Connecting to a Presto server Presto CLI provides a terminal-based interactive shell to run queries. You can connect to Presto server either through Presto CLI installed as part of the ibm-lh-client package or through Presto CLI installed separately. watsonx.data on Red Hat OpenShift To connect to a Presto Server from a client program or CLI, the following items are required: \u2022 Hostname and port for the Presto server or workstation where the IBM watsonx.data developer or stand-alone is installed. \u2022 Certificates served by the Presto server to establish trust. \u2022 Authorized user credentials to access the Presto server. Note: It is important to connect to the Presto server that uses its hostname and not its IP address. Because the TLS certificate that is served by the Presto Server is associated with a fully qualified host and domain-name (FQDN). Client programs, typically, cannot establish trust by using the IP address. With OpenShift Ingress in particular, DNS entries, based on hostnames, play an important role in routing to the intended Kubernetes Service. Tip: To confirm there is network access from your client workstation that needs to connect a Presto server you can test the access by using one of the following commands: curl -ki https://<presto-hostname>:<presto-portnumber> nc -v <presto-hostname> <presto-portnumber> \u2022 The Presto server exposes a HTTPs (TCP) port. Therefore, you can use any convenient HTTP or TCP- based utility to ensure that the Presto server can be accessed from your network. \u2022 When you run the curl command, the server may return HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized response. This is expected as the server is secured by authentication. \u2022 When you run the nc command, the server returns a success message. In watsonx.data, you can connect to the Presto server in multiple ways based on the platform and utilities you are using. See the following sections for more details: \u2022 Using built-in presto-cli in the developer edition \u2022 Using presto-cli and presto-run in the ibm-lh-client package \u2022 Using presto-cli executable (remote) \u2013']\n", "output_type": "stream"}], "execution_count": 20}, {"cell_type": "code", "source": "def make_prompt(context, question_text):\n    return (f\"{context}\\n\\nPlease answer a question using this text. \"\n          + f\"If the question is unanswerable, say \\\"unanswerable\\\".\"\n          + f\"\\n\\nQuestion: {question_text}\")\n\n\n# Build prompt w/ Milvus results\n# Embed retrieved passages(context) and user question into into prompt text\n\ncontext = \"\\n\\n\".join(relevant_chunks)\nprompt = make_prompt(context, question_text)\n\nprint(prompt)", "metadata": {"id": "85a0ccc0-43ef-4976-be3b-87a99a34f9be", "msg_id": "29346ac7-261a-424e-b8ad-3c3f27840772"}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "text": "the left pane, go to Catalogs > All catalogs to view the available catalogs. 3.

You can also monitor the status of the applications that are submitted in the instance. watsonx.data on Red Hat OpenShift About this task Viewing Spark details You can view the Spark details in list and topology views. 1. Click the name of Spark engine (either from list or topology view). Engine information window opens. 2. In the Details tab, you can view the following details: Field Description Display name The Spark engine name. Engine ID The unique identifier of the Spark instance. Description The description of the engine. Tags The tag that is specified at the time of registering an engine. Type The engine type. Here, IBM Analytics Engine (Spark). Instance URL The IBM Analytics Engine (Spark) URL. watsonx.data application endpoint The application submission endpoint. To submit an application by using API, see API Docs. Instance API endpoint The IBM Analytics Engine (Spark) API endpoint. History server endpoint The IBM Analytics Engine (Spark)\n\nname. 7. Select all the data present on the bucket to sync or create a catalog without any preexisting data. 8. After registration, click the catalog and go to Sync logs. You can see the status of synchronization (success, failure, partial success) and the last sync time. 9. After completing the synchronization, go to the Data manager. You can see the catalog that you created and the tables that are pulled from the bucket created by Snowflake. Note: You can use SQL editor (Query workspace) and use these tables to select query and insert data into existing table. 10. If Snowflake user makes data changes in the bucket and watsonx.data wants to pull those changes in the bucket, then click Sync data from UI for three strategy options: 402 IBM watsonx.data: Release V2.0.0 a. Sync all data: Synchronize all the data or update the existing table that was promoted earlier. b. Sync new data only: Pull the newly created table only. c. Sync existing data only: Update the table registered earlier to the latest changes only. Chapter 6. Working with data 403 Chapter 7. Connecting to a Presto server Presto CLI provides a terminal-based interactive shell to run queries. You can connect to Presto server either through Presto CLI installed as part of the ibm-lh-client package or through Presto CLI installed separately. watsonx.data on Red Hat OpenShift To connect to a Presto Server from a client program or CLI, the following items are required: \u2022 Hostname and port for the Presto server or workstation where the IBM watsonx.data developer or stand-alone is installed. \u2022 Certificates served by the Presto server to establish trust. \u2022 Authorized user credentials to access the Presto server. Note: It is important to connect to the Presto server that uses its hostname and not its IP address. Because the TLS certificate that is served by the Presto Server is associated with a fully qualified host and domain-name (FQDN). Client programs, typically, cannot establish trust by using the IP address. With OpenShift Ingress in particular, DNS entries, based on hostnames, play an important role in routing to the intended Kubernetes Service. Tip: To confirm there is network access from your client workstation that needs to connect a Presto server you can test the access by using one of the following commands: curl -ki https://<presto-hostname>:<presto-portnumber> nc -v <presto-hostname> <presto-portnumber> \u2022 The Presto server exposes a HTTPs (TCP) port. Therefore, you can use any convenient HTTP or TCP- based utility to ensure that the Presto server can be accessed from your network. \u2022 When you run the curl command, the server may return HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized response. This is expected as the server is secured by authentication. \u2022 When you run the nc command, the server returns a success message. In watsonx.data, you can connect to the Presto server in multiple ways based on the platform and utilities you are using. See the following sections for more details: \u2022 Using built-in presto-cli in the developer edition \u2022 Using presto-cli and presto-run in the ibm-lh-client package \u2022 Using presto-cli executable (remote) \u2013\n\nPlease answer a question using this text.
